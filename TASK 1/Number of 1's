Number of 1 bits.
 
Code:
n=2147483645
b=bin(n)
print(b)
c=0
for i in range(len(b)-2):
    bit=n&1
    if bit ==1:
        c+=1
    n=n>>1
print(c)
explain:
we are converting the integer number into its binary representation. Then we define c which is the counter for the 1 bits. We are running a loop for each element and using and operator to get the last bit. Checking if it is 1 or 0, if 1 increase the count.Finally doing right shift to move on to the next bit.
