Single number.
 
Code:
nums = [4,2,1,2,1]
d={}
for i in nums:
    if i in d.keys():
        d.pop(i)
    else:
        d[i]=1
a=list(d)
print(a[0])
Explain:
We are declaring a dictionary named d to maintain the count .here we are checking if the element already exists in the d or not .If it doesn’t exist then it added .if it exists that means that it appears twice in the array ,so we are removing the pair from d .finally I didn’t get how to print the key so I used list to get the number.
