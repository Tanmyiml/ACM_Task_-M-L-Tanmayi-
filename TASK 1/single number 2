Single number 2:
 
Code:
nums = [0,1,0,1,0,1,99]
i=0
while i <=len(nums)-1:
    a=nums[i]
    if a not in nums[:i] and a not in nums[i+1:]:
        print(a)
        break
    i+=1
Explain:
Here we are running a loop and finding out if the elements exists in the array elsewhere .If it doesnâ€™t exist then print it .
